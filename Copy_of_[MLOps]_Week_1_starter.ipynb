        "### Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "In the project this week, we will build a machine learning text classifier to predict news categories from the news article text. \n",
        "1. We will iterate on classification models with increasing level of complexity and improved performance. \n",
        "2. We will look at the impact of training data size on model performance.\n",
        "3. [advanced] As an extension, you will explore how to augment data efficiently to your existing training data (efficiency measured as improvement in performance normalized by volume of data augmented). The reason to consider efficiency is that in most real-world scenarios, additional data is typically unlabeled. In order to augment it to your training data, you have to get it annotated which incurs some time & money (either yoursself or through one of the existing annotation tools such as Labelbox, Scale etc). \n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the project there are suggested model architectures that we expect to work reasonably well for this problem. But if you wish to extend/modify any part of this pipeline, or explore new model architectures you should definitely feel free to do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Deliverables\n",
        "1. Train average word vector classifier and report model performance for training size = [500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 25000]\n",
        "2. Train transformer encoder classifier and report model performance for training size = [500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 25000]\n",
        "3. Report performance improvement on the test dataset from naive dataset augmentation outlined in the this notebook\n",
        "4. [stretch] Experiment with advanced data augmentation techniques (a few ideas & pointers given in the notebook below)\n"
